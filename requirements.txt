# matplotlib is usually a dependency of streamlit or other plotting libraries, 
# but good to list if directly used or if a specific version is needed.
# We primarily used st.bar_chart which handles its own backend.
# If you were to use matplotlib directly (e.g., fig, ax = plt.subplots()), then uncomment:
# matplotlib
